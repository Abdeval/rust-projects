# ðŸ¦€ My Rust Journey

Welcome to my **Rust Playground** â€” a collection of projects, experiments, and notes that document my **learning curve** with the Rust programming language.  
This repository is my personal logbook, starting from the basics and gradually building toward advanced concepts.

## ðŸ“œ About This Repository

This repo serves as:
- **A learning timeline** â€” each folder represents a milestone in my Rust journey.
- **A project archive** â€” from small exercises to full applications.
- **A reference** â€” including examples, code snippets, and notes for future me (and anyone else learning Rust).

Whether youâ€™re a beginner or curious about Rust, youâ€™ll find practical examples and code patterns here.

## ðŸ“… Learning Roadmap

Below is the **rough path** Iâ€™m following to learn Rust effectively:

1. **Basics**  
   - Variables & Mutability  
   - Data Types  
   - Functions & Expressions  
   - Control Flow (if, match, loops)

2. **Ownership & Borrowing**  
   - Understanding ownership rules  
   - References and borrowing  
   - Slices  

3. **Structs, Enums & Pattern Matching**  
   - Defining and using structs  
   - Enum patterns  
   - Destructuring

4. **Collections & Iterators**  
   - Vectors, Strings, HashMaps  
   - Iterator traits & adapters

5. **Error Handling**  
   - `Result` & `Option`  
   - `unwrap`, `expect`, and error propagation (`?`)

6. **Modules & Crates**  
   - Organizing code with modules  
   - Using external crates via Cargo

7. **Concurrency & Asynchronous Rust**  
   - Threads  
   - `async`/`await`  
   - Channels

8. **Advanced Topics** *(in progress)*  
   - Lifetimes  
   - Traits & Generics  
   - Macros  
   - Unsafe Rust
